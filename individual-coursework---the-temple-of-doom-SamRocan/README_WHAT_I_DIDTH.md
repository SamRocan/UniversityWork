What I did
==========
In this project i worked extended dan completed an existing codebase to complete the
"Temple of Doom" Game. This program extensively tested my use of Java, implementing 
what I have been taught throughout the SDP course. On top of implementing design patterns
and using packages, i was able to work with for the first time and intricate GUI, which not
only created a clean looking final result, but allowed for me to be able to see the
professional abilities of what can be created using Java.

What Methods I Created
==========
Two additional method were created on top of the Explore and Escape Methods
- The sortingAlgorithm returns a list of nodes that optimizes the route out of
the maze.
- the HelperAlgorithm sort the list in the correct order assisting 
  the main sorting Algorithm.
  
Additionally, two JUnit test files were created
- One to test Explore Method
- One to test Escape Method

Problems / What could be done better
==========
I found that the method to find the orb although functional, was quite long winded,
and prone to error resulting in a somewhat unintelligible movement to the orb. With
more time and more thorough research I believe I could achieve I better outcome.
